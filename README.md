# TV_Script_Generation
This repository contain the code used to develop the project Gerenate Script TV for the series Seinfeld Chronicles, this project is part of Deep Learning Nano Degree from Udacity. The aim of this project was developing a LSTM model to learn about it and improve my skills with deep learning usign the knowledge acquired learning by Udacity couse.


### About source
The data source was provided by udacity/kaggle competition, containing scripts from Seinfield seasons:
[Seinfeld Chronicles dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/thec03u5/seinfeld-chronicles#scripts.csv)


### Model
Was used a LSTM model usign Pytorch library and Python 3.7

### Rights
Don't use this model for compertial proposes. You could learn by it or use the code as base for other projects.
